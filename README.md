# EE241 LAB

## University of Washington

This repository contains the lab materials for EE241 at the University of Washington.  
It may be used as a reference but please do not copy the work.

## Collaboration Instructions

Each Lab folder contains resources from the class.

### Lecture Examples

It includes examples discussed in the lecture.

### Output Examples

It includes expected outputs for the lab exercises.

### Report Template

It includes a template for the lab report.  
***Please do not modify the lab report template.***

Our lab group, Team 29's policy is to work individually on the lab exercises and then compare results.  
Also, since everyone is not comfortable with git, we will be working on the `main` branch only.

#### Procedure Instructions

Copy the template file of each lab as `Lab#_yourname.ipynb`.  
After completing the exercise, please push your work into the `main` branch and share it with the team.  

```bash
git commit -m "Your Commit Message"
git push
```  

To take a look at team's work, please pull updated sources from the `main` branch.  

```bash
git pull
```  

To avoid conflicts, please do not modify files other than your own.  
At the end of the lab, copy another template as `Lab#_handin.ipynb` and fill in the final code after reviewing each teammates' code.  
Then, submit `Lab#_handin.ipynb` to the Canvas and make sure to include names at the top of the report file.
